Description: The package implements Monte Carlo and numerical likelihoods for stage frequency, or, 
             cohort data. Stage frequency data are collected by following a cohort over time and 
             assessing the numbers of individuals in different stagesat a set of time points. 
             To estimate parameters for models of such data, an adaptive MCMC sampler is 
             implemented. The sampler can be used in combination with the stochastic and numerical 
             likelihoods to provide Bayesian estimates of parameters.
